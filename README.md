What is HiPowAR?

HiPowAR
HIGHLY EFFICIENT POWER PRODUCTION BY GREEN AMMONIA TOTAL OXIDATION IN A MEMBRANE REACTOR
In HiPowAR, a new membrane reactor is being developed for the efficient
energy production from ammonia. The project focuses on
a breakthrough in the direct conversion of ammonia into energy.
This is driving the acceptance of ammonia as a synthetic fuel without CO2 emissions.
without CO2 emissions. The membrane reactor developed
is based on a MIEC (Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductor) membrane and achieves
higher efficiencies in energy production than internal combustion engines and steam generators.

Project duration: 48 Month | Project start: September 1st, 2020
